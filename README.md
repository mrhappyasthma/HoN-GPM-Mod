##About
This is a mod for the [Heroes of Newerth](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/) (HoN) video game to show an on-screen overlay displaying your GPM stat on the overlay.

This mod was originally written by biomass. All credits go to him/her. Check out the original thread [here](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?79795-Gold-per-Minute-%28movable-frame%29-1-2-%2819-Feb-2011%29&p=15664502&viewfull=1#post15664502).

##Installing
0. You will need the [HoN Mod Manager](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?25883-HoN-Modification-Manager-1-3-6) to use this mod. So first, install that.

1. Once that is installed, you can download the latest release of the GPM mod from [here](https://github.com/mrhappyasthma/HoN-GPM-Mod/releases/download/Latest/gpm.honmod).

2. Place the downloaded `gpm.honmod` file into your Heroes of Newerth directory under `game/mod` folders. For example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of Newerth\game\mods`.

3. Open up `HoN Mod Manager` and enable `Gold/Min` mod: <br/><br/>

4. Click `File -> Apply Mods`: <br/><br/>

*Note: You will need to re-apply mods every time HoN is updated.* <br/><br/>
*This is done manually by opening HoN Mod Manager. It will detect the version change and give you a pop-up asking if you'd like to re-apply. Click yes, and you're good to go! If not, you're client WILL be very buggy.*

##Updating
Updating is also done through the HoN Mod Manager. Simply click on `File -> Download Mod Updates`: <br/><br/>
![Click the 'File' tab and click on the 'Download Mod Updates' option.](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7bed1c0b728ecc34d093de1197aab7950472fa7d/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f726264515a7a752e706e67)

##Configuring the Overlay
###Default Options
You can change some default options by going the HoN `options` menu (the gear icon). Then go to the `Mods` tab. Scroll down to the `Gold/Min` mod settings, and configure them how you please: <br/><br/>

*Note: You need to click `Apply` when you're done making changes!*

###Configuring the Movable Frame
The in-game overlay is considered a movable frame, and is configured through the HoN movable frames options.

1. The first step here is to enter a practice game (through the `Hosted Games` button in HoN).

2. Once you are in a practice game, open up the HoN menu while in-game by clicking on `Menu -> Chat`: <br/><br/>:

3. Go to the HoN `options` menu (the gear icon). Then go to the `Mods` tab. At the top of this tab, click the `Configure` button under `Movable Frames`: <br/><br/>

4. This will allow you to configure the movable frames however you want (including the `Buy Back Gold` overlay). You can simply click and drag the frame around to the position you like on screen. <br/><br/>
*Note: You can also turn it off through here (although, it is worth removing it from the `HoN Mod Manager` completely, if you wish to never use it again).* <br/><br/>
