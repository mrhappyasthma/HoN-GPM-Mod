##Installing
0. You will need the [HoN Mod Manager](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?25883-HoN-Modification-Manager-1-3-6) to use this mod. So first, install that.

1. Once that is installed, you can download the latest release of the GPM mod from [here](https://github.com/mrhappyasthma/HoN-GPM-Mod/releases/download/Latest/gpm.honmod).

2. Place the downloaded `gpm.honmod` file into your Heroes of Newerth directory under `game/mod` folders. For example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of Newerth\game\mods`.

3. Open up `HoN Mod Manager` and enable `Gold/Min` mod: <br/><br/>

4. Click `File -> Apply Mods`: <br/><br/>

*Note: You will need to re-apply mods every time HoN is updated.* <br/><br/>
*This is done manually by opening HoN Mod Manager. It will detect the version change and give you a pop-up asking if you'd like to re-apply. Click yes, and you're good to go! If not, you're client WILL be very buggy.*

##Updating
Updating is also done through the HoN Mod Manager. Simply click on `File -> Download Mod Updates`: <br/><br/>
